# Social-Login-with-ASP.NET-CORE-3.1-and-Angular-8
Login with Facebook and Google with Angular 8 for client-side and ASP.NET CORE 3.1 as Server-side.

Gets user details on Angular with angular-social-login and sends it to the backend (Asp.Net Core Api) to create a JWT and saves the data in the database.

Then returns some data which includes the JWT to Angular so you can add the JWT as a request header on every request.

If you have any issues, you can reach out to me.
